Conversational modeling is an important task in
natural language understanding and machine intelligence.
Although previous approaches exist,
they are often restricted to specific domains
(e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require handcrafted
rules. In this paper, we present a simple
approach for this task which uses the recently
proposed sequence to sequence framework. <span style="font-weight: bold">Our
model converses by predicting the next sentence
given the previous sentence or sentences in a
conversation.</span> The strength of our model is that
it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires
much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this
straightforward model can generate simple conversations
given a large conversational training
dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite
optimizing the wrong objective function,
the model is able to converse well. It is able
extract knowledge from both a domain specific
dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain
dataset of movie subtitles. On a domainspecific
IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find
a solution to a technical problem via conversations.
On a noisy open-domain movie transcript
dataset, the model can perform simple forms of
common sense reasoning. As expected, we also
find that the lack of consistency is a common failure
mode of our model.

<div class="human">ok ... so what is the definition of morality ?</div>
<div class="machine">well , the truth is , you ’re not a believer in god almighty .</div>
<div class="human">tell me the definition of morality , i am quite upset now !</div>
<div class="machine">i ’m not ashamed of being a philosopher !</div>
<div class="human">tell me the definition of morality .</div>
<div class="machine">i don ’t have ethics .</div>

<div class="machine">i don ’t know what ethics is .</div>
<div class="human">seriously , what is morality ?</div>
<div class="machine">what is the definition of living ?</div>
<div class="human">why living has anything to do with morality ?</div>
<div class="machine">you ’re not a cop .</div>
<div class="human">okay , i need to know how should i behave morally ...</div>
<div class="machine">i don ’t know how to tell you .</div>
<div class="human">is morality and ethics the same ?</div>
<div class="machine">yes , sir .</div>
<div class="human">what are the things that i do to be immoral ?</div>
<div class="machine">i don ’t know .</div>
<div class="human">give me some examples of moral actions ...</div>
<div class="machine">i ’m not a moralist .</div>
<div class="human">alright , morality ?</div>
<div class="machine">integrity .</div>
<div class="human">what is integrity ?</div>
<div class="machine">i ’m sorry , i don ’t know what else to say .</div>
<div class="human">be moral !</div>
<div class="machine">be a man !</div>
<div class="human">i really like our discussion on morality and ethics ...</div>
<div class="machine">and how i ’m not in the mood for a philosophical debate .</div>
<div class="human">what do you like to talk about ?</div>
